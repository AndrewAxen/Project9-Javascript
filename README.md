# Project9 - Add Javascript and Projects

## Requirements:

##Step One

Implement Javascript in the personal website.
One suggestion would be to add either an image slider or a dark/light mode toggle (or both).

##Step Two

Build out a projects section for your website (or a projects page, if your website has multiple pages).
It doesn’t have to be too complicated, but choose 2 to 3 things you’ve coded (either from this course or from outside this course), push the code to GitHub, and then for each include the following elements on your website: an image (screenshot of the UI component or full page you built), a title, a brief description, and a link to the GitHub repository

I have successfully implemented a slider on the homepage of my personal website, showcasing reviews about me. This slider is built using JavaScript and allows users to navigate through reviews using arrows and dots. Additionally, I have created a "Projects" section on a separate page, where I showcase three coding projects I have worked on. Each project includes an image (a screenshot of the UI), a title, a brief description, and a link to the respective GitHub repository. All projects code has been uploaded to GitHub for easy access and collaboration.
